Write a python program that takes a integer between 0 and 15 as input and displays the number of '1' s in its binary form.(Hint:use python bitwise operator.
Sample Input
3
Sample Output:
2
Explanation:
The binary representation of 3 is 011, hence there are 2 ones in it. so the output is 2.

For example:
Input	Result
3	2

Program:
a=int(input())
binary=bin(a)[2:]
c=0
for char in binary:
    if char=='1':
        c=c+1
print(c)
